## **A few important things to know about this guide**

- **I'll mostly be covering things that the game doesn't really tell you right off the bat, but are important to know.** I won't cover things like combat, movement, etc. You should be able to figure those things out.

## **I'll start with the server settings.**

- 99% of the base PvE settings are perfectly fine, but **I would recommend disabling "Teleport Bound Items".** 
- Having this option enabled will prevent you from fast traveling while you have resources in your inventory. This might sound fine to have enabled, but **I've found it just pads out the game more than anything.** Some people in the Vrising community will disagree with me and that's totally fine. I prefer not to have it enabled. It was one of the first changes I went back and made once I created a server.

- **I will place a guide at the end for editing your server settings after the initial setup, if you end up wanting to do that.**


## **Follow the tutorial. No really.**

**Follow the tutorial up on the top left of the screen.**
<br>

- It seems like a basic tip, but **all of the crafting recipes are locked behind the tutorial quests. The sooner you do them, the sooner you will unlock important crafting recipes.**


## **Sunlight**

- This one is pretty straight forward, but one of the the more neat mechanics in Vrising.

- **Sun = bad <br>
    Shadows = good**

- I really enjoy this aspect of the game.
Try to do things at night (obviously, cause vampire).

## **Blood**

- **One of the unique main mechanics in Vrising is blood.** At the bottom middle of the screen you'll see your blood pool. Blood will be automatically spent if you lose health to recover you to a cap. If you run out of blood, you will start to die.

- **If you hold ctrl on your keyboard, you will see an option for "Blood Mend".** This will put you in a state where you actively consume blood to recover lost health. **This will be your main healing ability.** Yet again, be careful not to use all of your blood.

- **Rats can be used to refill a small amount of blood if you are low.** Be sure to collect every rat you see and keep a handful on you at all times.

- **When enemies get low, you will have the option to "Feed".** This is sort of like a finishing move, but **if you let the bar fill up, you will consume them and entirely refill your blood pool.** If you left click, you will instantly kill the enemy but you will not get the blood. *This can be useful to do if you are fighting multiple enemies and you want to kill a high priority target.*

- **Every enemy you can feed off of will have a different blood type and quality.** The higher the percentage, the more bonuses you get from it. If you hover your mouse over an enemy, you will see their blood type and quality.

- On the left side of your blood pool you will see a little icon with a percentage below it. If you hover over the icon with your mouse, you will see some stats about your current blood.

- **I recommend finding a good worker blood if you plan on resource gathering.** It will increase your resource yield from gathering spots (trees, rocks, ore, etc). *Very handy.*

- If you plan on fighting a strong enemy, go find a warrior, brute, or creature blood.

- If you are playing with someone else, you can use the "Expose Vein" skill in the ctrl menu to let another player feed from you. It's nice if you have a good blood and want to share it.

- You'll eventually unlock servants which lets you keep enemies in a jail and use them as a more or less "permanent" source of a specific blood. But that's sort of mid game. I figured I'd still put it here just so you have it in the back of your mind.

## **Equipment and leveling**

- This is one of the stranger things about Vrising. **Your level is directly tied to your equipment.** Your character does not "level up", per say.

- **If you see an enemy with a skull instead of a level, do not fight them.** You will lose, regardless of how well you play. Get better equipment before you fight them.

- **Your equipment also has durability and will be useless if it breaks.** If equipment is broken, it will not count towards your level. Keep this in mind. If a piece of equipment breaks during a fight, you might lose a fight that was winnable with that piece intact.

## **Castle building**

- I won't go too much into this (as there's a ton of stuff), but the important thing is that you **press the B key to open your castle building menu.**
I have no clue why the tutorial doesn't tell you this, but it doesn't. I literally had to google it again while writing this.
You will unlock multiple tabs on the bottom as you progress.

- **When you pick a spot to place your castle, find a place with a lot of space. Like a lot of space**. You do not want to move this thing. *It's a pain.*

- **Castles require blood essence or else they will "decay".** Pretty much making them able to be destroyed by anything that walks by. It's more important in PvP, but it's necessary to keep them topped up in PvE as well.

- **You will not get the ability to make a roof on your castle until way later into the game** (an odd choice from the devs). Keep that in mind while building, since all of your crafting will be done in your base and is difficult when the sun is out.

- You can build multiple castles (and the amount can be changed in the server settings). *I would recommend building a second castle somewhere else across the map.* You will eventually be able to craft teleporters to travel between bases. You can also teleport using the world teleporters. Try and place bases keeping in mind the world teleporters. You can have a nice network to get around the map easily if you plan a bit ahead.


## **Blood Altar**

- **This is the most important base item in the game.**
Building it will essentially be the end of the "tutorial" and the game will open up proper.

- **This will let you tracks the boss enemies or "V Blood".**
*These enemies are the main progression in the game.* They will unlock most things in the game.

- **The first one you should go after is the Alpha Wolf.** It will grant you a very important movement ability.

## **Other random things**

- **Try out all of the weapon types.** They're all neat. I'm a big fan of the hammer, *especially once you unlock a few moves for it.*

- **Explore.** Get accustomed to the map. It is the same in every playthrough (for better or for worse).

- There is a setting to randomize the V Blood enemies and their drops if you eventually want to play through it again, but the map will remain the same.

- **Use the "Compulsively Count" option when you're transferring items into chests.** It will automatically move items into chests that already have those items. Extremely useful. Saves tons of time when you come back with resources.

- **Middle click splits stacks.** I have no clue why they didn't just go with the Minecraft method. Minecraft does it right. Like, if it's not broke, don't fix it. But eh.

- **Build a research table as soon as you are able to.** This will allow you to unlock many important castle pieces.

- **Swap over from chests to bookshelves as soon as you can.** They hold way more than a chest and take up less space.

- **Build your crafting tables (sawmills, forges, etc) into rooms.** They will get bonuses if they are in a closed room.

- If you have the correct flooring in a room, your crafting tables will also get a bonus. The flooring is unlocked randomly through the research table.
I don't really like that part of the game, but that's how it is, so eh.

## **Closing thoughts**

That's most of the things you'll need to know to get through the early game. It might seem like a lot, but there's a ton more.

- **Early to mid game is where this game really shines in my opinion.** As I mentioned in my previous comment, the end game can get really grind-y. *But, you can alter your game settings to adjust some of that grind if you so choose.*

- I tried to cover things the game doesn't explicitly tell you. **My first 10 or so hours were mostly just figuring these things out.**

Hopefully this guide helps you get to the actual game quicker and lets you bypass that learning curve.

### **How to change your server settings after you start**

I figured I would put this here in case you wanted to change some stuff down the road. 
<br>It's a bit finicky if you don't know what you're doing.

---

You can adjust the settings of the server after you've created it by going to `Continue` from the main menu, picking your save from the list on the bottom, then clicking `Go to Directory` on the right side. Open the `"ServerHostSettings.json"` in a text editor (I would personally recommend `Notepad++`) and you will see the server's current settings. Your json file will be mostly empty if you have not tampered with the original settings.


### **BE SURE TO MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR "ServerHostSettings.json" BEFORE YOU EDIT ANYTHING**


Here is a link that has a template for all of the server settings.

It also explains all of the settings for it. Really solid site.

https://basicallyaverage.com/change-game-settings-v-rising/


If there is something you want to change but do not see it in your json file, you can just copy the entry from that page into your json file.
The json file is broken up into certain chunks though, so be sure to place the setting you want to change in the correct chunk and in the correct place. 

- **Use the above site to make sure you are placing that piece of code in the correct spot.**

For instance, if you wanted to disable the teleport bound items setting, you would put

```
"TeleportBoundItems": false,
```

in the top chunk.

**The order of the entries is important and your game will display as "Corrupted" if something is out of order. Do not panic if that happens.** Your data is still there. Fix your `ServerHostSettings.json` and it will be fixed. You can copy the entire template from that site and paste it in if you super duper mess up your json. Just backup the file before you edit it and you'll be fine.

### **BE SURE TO PLACE ENTRIES IN THE CORRECT SPOT IN THE JSON FILE. VRISING IS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THAT**
